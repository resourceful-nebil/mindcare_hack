Allow yourself to enjoy a good laugh and let go of stress.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default RelaxationExercise;\r\n"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,MAAM,OAAO;AAAC,SAAAC,MAAA,IAAAC,OAAA;AAE1B,MAAMC,kBAAkB,GAAGA,CAAA,KAAM;EAC/B,oBACED,OAAA;IAAAE,QAAA,gBACEF,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAI;IAAoB;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAE7BN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAI;IAAgC;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACzCN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;IAEH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAEJN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAI;IAAiB;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC1BN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;IAEH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAEJN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAI;IAAiB;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC1BN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;IAEH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAEJN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAI;IAAuB;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAChCN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;IAEH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAEJN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAI;IAAoB;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC7BN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;IAEH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAI;IAAuC;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAClDN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;IAEH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAEJN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAI;IAA6B;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACtCN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;IAEH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAEJN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAI;IAAqB;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC9BN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;IAEH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAEJN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAI;IAAkB;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC3BN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;IAEH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAEJN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAI;IAA4C;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACrDN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;IAEH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAI;IAAmC;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC5CN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;IAEH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAEJN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAI;IAA8B;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACvCN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;IAEH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAEJN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAI;IAAqC;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC9CN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;IAEH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAEJN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAI;IAA6B;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACtCN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;IAEH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAEJN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAI;IAAgC;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACzCN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;IAEH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAI;IAAgB;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACzBN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;IAEH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAEJN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAI;IAAkB;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC3BN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;IAEH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAEJN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAI;IAAgB;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACzBN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;IAEH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAEJN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAI;IAA2B;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACpCN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;IAEH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAEJN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAI;IAAiB;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC1BN,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;IAEH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC;EAAA;IAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;IAAAC,UAAA;IAAAC,YAAA;EAAA,OAEC,CAAC;AAEV,CAAC;AAACC,EAAA,GAxGIN,kBAAkB;AA0GxB,eAAeA,kBAAkB;AAAC,IAAAM,EAAA;AAAAC,YAAA,CAAAD,EAAA"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
